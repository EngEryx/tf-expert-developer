# TensorFlow Developer Expert Preparation

- Notes, Excercises while taking Deep Learning TensorFlow in practise Course on Coursera.
* My goals are:-
    * First, improve/refresh my skills in readiness for Tensorflow Developer Certificate.
    * Utilize Covid Lockdown to the level best.
    * Solve problems, where I work... How can solve the world's problems using AI.
